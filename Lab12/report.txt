1.
Finished the work of bstree, and constructed a number of modules well.
2.
We can get all the ordered keys from the BST tree species without much additional operation. But there is no way to easily get all the ordered keys from the HashTable.
It is easy to use batree to find a value larger (or smaller) than a certain value, or suitable for a range query. But Hashtable is relatively complicated.
Corresponding to bstree, all operations can be guaranteed to be completed in O(LgN) time. But Hashtable sometimes consumes a lot of time.
